# birthplace_region_predict_python_webapp
This project shows how to build&amp;deploy python web app using keras and tensorflow to heroku

This is for internship project for university. I said this prediction will not accurate due to the pictures from dataset is manipulated, some people's makeup and some face transformations(surgery etc.) makes people like each other and removes some genetic and regional factors. If you find pictures or take pictures of natural faces of these people, probably you will get more accurate results.
